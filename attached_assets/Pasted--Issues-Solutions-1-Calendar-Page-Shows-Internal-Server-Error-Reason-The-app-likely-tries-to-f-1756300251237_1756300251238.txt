✅ Issues & Solutions
1. Calendar Page Shows Internal Server Error

Reason: The app likely tries to fetch or render menu data from a missing or broken endpoint, or the calendar component is rendering null data.
Fix:

Ensure the route for /calendar (React Router) is correct.

Ensure menu data exists in state or database before rendering.

Display menus like:

[Date] - [Main Dish] by [Assigned Person]
           [Side Dish] by [Assigned Person]

2. Admin Can Select Floor & Filter Data

Implementation:

Add a Floor Selector (dropdown) in the Admin Dashboard.

When Admin picks a floor:

Filter members, menus, tasks by that floor.

Example:

const [selectedFloor, setSelectedFloor] = useState('All Floors');
const filteredMenus = menus.filter(menu => menu.floor === selectedFloor);

3. First-Time Login → Create Username & Password

Workflow:

Admin adds email → store { email, role, verified: false }.

When user logs in:

Check if verified === false:

Redirect to Create Username & Password Page.

After successful creation → set verified = true.

If verified === true:

Redirect to Enter Username & Password Page.

4. Add Back to Homepage Button

On both pages (Create Username & Password, Enter Username & Password):

<button onClick={() => navigate('/')}>Back to Homepage</button>

5. Profile Picture Upload

Add a file input in profile:

<input type="file" accept="image/*" onChange={handleProfilePicUpload} />


Store in localStorage or Firebase Storage.

Display uploaded picture on profile page.

6. Edit Functionality in Admin's People Page

In Admin's People table:

Show Edit Button for each user → allows changing role, email, floor.

Update in DB.

7. Push Notifications (2 Days Before Cooking)

Use browser notifications (via Notification API) or service workers.

Example:

if (Notification.permission === 'granted') {
    new Notification('Reminder: You are cooking in 2 days!');
}


Trigger via a scheduled job or React useEffect when loading assignments.

8. Add Dish Type in Menu

In Add Menu form:

<select>
  <option>Main Dish</option>
  <option>Side Dish</option>
</select>


Store in DB → Show in calendar:

Date: Main Dish - Biryani (by Ali)
      Side Dish - Salad (by Sara)

9. Admin Profile Update (Username & Password)

On profile page:

Form to update username and password.

Save to DB → After update, force logout → log in with new credentials.

✅ Database Design (Simple JSON / Firebase)
users: [
  {
    email: "abc@example.com",
    role: "admin" | "pantryHead" | "teaManager" | "member",
    floor: "2nd Floor",
    username: "Ali",
    password: "hashedPassword",
    verified: true/false,
    profilePic: "url"
  }
]

menus: [
  {
    date: "2025-08-30",
    floor: "2nd Floor",
    mainDish: { name: "Biryani", assignedTo: "Ali" },
    sideDish: { name: "Salad", assignedTo: "Sara" }
  }
]
